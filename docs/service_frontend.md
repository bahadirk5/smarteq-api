## Error Handling

- Implement appropriate error handling for all API requests
- Display meaningful error messages to users
- Handle validation errors with clear feedback
- Provide confirmation dialogs for critical actions (e.g., changing repair status)
- Show loading states during API calls

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**
   - Implement role-based access control in UI
   - Hide UI elements based on user permissions
   - Ensure proper access control for service management functions
   - Restrict sensitive information to authorized personnel only

2. **Form Security**
   - Implement proper input validation
   - Sanitize inputs to prevent XSS attacks
   - Secure file upload handling for repair documentation

## UI/UX Recommendations

1. **Service Dashboard**
   - Overview of active repairs
   - Technician workload visualization
   - Service backlog monitoring
   - Repair status distribution chart
   - Pending customer approvals highlight

2. **Repair Workflow Visualization**
   - Clear status indicators with progress visualization
   - Timeline view of repair history
   - Notification system for status changes
   - Estimated vs. actual repair time tracking

3. **Customer Communication Interface**
   - Automated status update notifications
   - Service quote approval interface
   - Repair completion notifications
   - Customer feedback collection

4. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Service performance metrics
